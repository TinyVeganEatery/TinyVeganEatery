Lightly grease a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3Zkwmuy\">1-pound loaf pan</a> with oil or vegan butter.<br><br>Mix the wet ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the soy milk, pumpkin puree, olive oil, and vanilla extract until smooth and well combined.<br><br>Mix the dry ingredients: In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, coconut sugar, baking powder, baking soda, pumpkin spice mix, cinnamon, and salt.<br><br>Prepare the batter: Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients in two parts. Gently fold the mixture after each addition until no dry pockets remain. Be careful not to over mix. Once combined, fold in the chocolate and white chocolate chips evenly throughout the batter.<br><br>Assemble the loaf: Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula or knife. Sprinkle generously with more chocolate chips.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Bake</b>: Place the pan on an aluminum baking sheet or tray, and bake for 50-60 minutes. The loaf should double, and the top will turn golden brown. Check for doneness around the 50-minute mark by inserting a toothpick or knife into the center; it should come out clean or with a few crumbs. If necessary, bake in additional 5-minute intervals until done.<br><br><b>Storage</b>:<br><i>At room temperature:</i> Once cooled, wrap any leftovers tightly in plastic wrap or foil, or place them in an airtight container. It will keep for up to 5 days at room temperature, as long as the environment isn’t too warm.<br><i>In the fridge:</i> The loaf can also be refrigerated for up to 7 days.<br><i>To freeze:</i> Slice the bread and separate the slices with parchment paper. Wrap well or place them in a sealed container. Freeze for up to 1 month. To defrost, let the slices thaw at room temperature for a couple of hours.<br><br>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    \n  </p>",
